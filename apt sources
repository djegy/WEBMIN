create webmin repositories
Using the Webmin APT repository
If you like to install and update Webmin via APT, edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file on your system and add the line :
deb https://download.webmin.com/download/repository sarge contrib

You should also fetch and install my GPG key with which the repository is signed, with the commands :
cd /root
wget https://download.webmin.com/jcameron-key.asc
apt-key add jcameron-key.asc
You will now be able to install with the commands :
apt-get install apt-transport-https
apt-get update
apt-get install webmin
All dependencies should be resolved automatically.
